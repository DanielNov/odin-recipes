# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin HTML project. 
The project is a website for various recipes. At the end of the project I will have learnt how to create a website project and push it to my github repo.
It's a start of a long journey to becoming a web developer. Later I will be able to make the website look more aesthetic with CSS. I am excited to start!
